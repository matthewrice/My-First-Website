# 1.1 Introduction to HTML and CSS

Before I started The Iron Yard, I was assigned pre-work that introduced me to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub.  

On Day 1 at The Iron Yard, we were tasked with creating an awesomely ugly website. The purpose of this assignment was to assess my skill level as a Front End Engineer.

The instructions we were given are provided below:
  1. In the terminal, create a code directory in your Documents directory.
  2. Create a new project directory in your code directory named 1.1-personal-website.
  3. Add an index.html file
  4. Add a styles.css file
  5. Practice HTML - Create a simple web page with some HTML content. The uglier and more html you can muster, the better!
  6. Practice CSS - Add some styles. Create a stylesheet with some selectors and rules.
  7. Add at least one image to your awesomely ugly site.
  8. Deploy your site:
    a. Create a repo on github under your account.
    b. From the terminal, do the following:
      1.) git init
      2.) git add index.html styles.css
      3.) git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"
      4.) git remote add origin SSH-GIT-REPO-ADDRESS-HERE
      5.) git push -u origin master
      6.) git checkout -b gh-pages
      7.) git push -u origin gh-pages
  9. Submit the http address found in your browser's address bar for the master branch.
